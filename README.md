# Home Camera System

Self-hosted, Ring-style camera viewer + controller for an Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB with an attached Raspberry Pi camera. The Jetson is the server. Phones and laptops are clients running the same installable PWA — open it in a browser, "Add to Home Screen" on Android, and you have an app icon that launches into a fullscreen, app-feeling camera dashboard.

## Features

- Live WebRTC video from the Jetson (~200ms glass-to-glass on LAN)
- Event timeline plus a short-retention continuous-playback archive and bounded range export
- Home, Away, Night, and Privacy operating modes with mode-aware alerts
- One notification per visit, followed by a quiet clip-ready update
- Daily activity digests, unknown-person review, and tamper alerts
- Recording-time privacy masks that also protect live video and snapshots
- Line-crossing and loitering rules, plus experimental porch-object delivery/collection tracking
- Local metadata search, multi-camera visit stories, and incident evidence bundles
- Face-quality filtering, identity correction/merge tools, and per-person alert preferences
- Owner-configured push, webhook, and MQTT automations with masked credentials
- Protected clips, storage-runway forecasting, and expiring revocable share links
- Software-ready two-way Opus audio, physical doorbell input, and optional acoustic-event watcher
- Guarded deterrence adapter with foreground confirmation, arming, cooldown, and audit history
- Recovery-derived outage history with an explicit external-monitor limitation
- Push notifications to phone when something is detected
- Remote control of the Jetson: capture photo, reboot, toggle detection, view stats
- One codebase, two surfaces: Android home screen + any browser
- No app stores, no cloud. You own the box, you own the data.

## Architecture

```
RPi Camera ─► GStreamer ─► MediaMTX ──WebRTC────────► Client <video>
                  │             ├─fMP4 archive──────► FastAPI timeline
                  │             └─RTSP audio (opt.)─► acoustic watcher
                  └─► Detection ─► event ─► FastAPI ─WS/Push─► Client / Phone
Client ──REST──► FastAPI ─► control commands
```

Three processes on the Jetson:

1. **MediaMTX** — video gateway. Owns the camera (`nvarguscamerasrc` + NVENC), serves RTSP for the detection worker and WebRTC for browsers.
2. **FastAPI server** (`server/`) — control + events + Web Push, in a Docker container.
3. **Detection worker** (`detection/`) — SSD-MobileNet-v2 via jetson-inference (TensorRT FP16) on the Jetson host, decodes the RTSP feed via NVDEC, evaluates optional spatial rules, and POSTs detection events to the FastAPI server. A separate disabled-by-default watcher handles optional audio metadata so microphone failures cannot destabilize vision.

One static bundle on the client side (`client/dist/`), bind-mounted into the FastAPI container and served as the SPA root with a path-traversal-guarded fallback.

## Quick start

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at http://localhost:5173. By default the dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000`. Adjust in `client/vite.config.ts` if the server runs elsewhere (e.g. directly on the Jetson at `http://jetson.local:8000`).

### Server

```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python -m app.scripts.gen_vapid     # writes vapid_private.pem + vapid_public.pem, prints public key
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Open http://localhost:8000/api/status to verify it's up.

### MediaMTX

Download the matching arm64 release for the Jetson: https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases

```bash
./mediamtx deploy/mediamtx.yml
```

### Optional audio and doorbell hardware

The audio/doorbell paths stay disabled until hardware is configured. On the
Jetson, set `HOMECAM_MIC_DEVICE` (for example `hw:2,0`) before running
`deploy/run-camera-microphone.sh`; `HOMECAM_MIC_BITRATE` defaults to `32000`.
Speaker output is deliberately fail-closed: copy `deploy/mediamtx.env.example`
to `/etc/homecam/mediamtx.env`, set an explicit `HOMECAM_SPEAKER_DEVICE`, and
create the configured root-owned enable-marker file. Without both, the
`deploy/run-talk-speaker.sh` hook exits without opening audio hardware.
`HOMECAM_SPEAKER_VOLUME` defaults to `1.0`. For a physical button, point the
detection worker at its GPIO value file with
`DETECT_DOORBELL_GPIO_VALUE_PATH`; `DETECT_DOORBELL_ACTIVE_LOW=1` is the
default. These are host-process variables, not FastAPI container settings.

Browser talk/listen sessions use scoped, one-time FastAPI media grants that
expire after 60 seconds. MediaMTX's HTTP callback allows anonymous WebRTC reads
only for exact video paths, allows host-only RTSP publishers/readers, and
requires those grants for remote `talk` publication or `listen` reads. Grant
issuance and consumption both fail while audio is disabled or Privacy is active.

Secure clip-share links are time-limited bearer URLs. The server stores only a
hash, marks both link creation and clip delivery `private, no-store`, suppresses
token-bearing Uvicorn access lines, and supports owner revocation by share ID.

`deploy/systemd/homecam-audio-detect.service` is installed as an available unit
but is intentionally not enabled or started. Its local signal heuristics are a
conservative convenience feature, not a certified smoke alarm, glass-break
detector, or life-safety device. It stores and transmits event metadata only;
raw microphone audio is discarded rather than recorded by the watcher.

### Continuous playback storage

MediaMTX stream-copies the already encoded `cam` path into five-minute fMP4
segments under `recordings/continuous/` and deletes them after two hours. At
the default 2.5 Mbps bitrate the nominal two-hour window is roughly 2.3 GB.
MediaMTX v1.18's asynchronous cleaner can temporarily retain close to three
hours (about 3.4 GB), without another decoder, encoder, or CUDA context. The
authenticated FastAPI timeline indexes and serves those files; MediaMTX's
unauthenticated playback server remains disabled.
Configured masks are applied before encoding, and Privacy mode forces a
full-frame mask, so the continuous archive receives the same redacted pixels
as Live, snapshots, and event clips. Full-frame Privacy generates black NV12
streams without opening the physical camera; partial zones use the GPU
compositor before both hardware encoders.

Timeline MP4s and incident ZIPs share a private export workspace. Defaults allow
two outstanding timeline jobs, cap retained files plus conservative pending
reservations at 5 GiB, and preserve at least 4 GiB of free disk. Capacity is
rechecked before a completed temporary is published; rejected requests return a
safe actionable error rather than filling storage.

The built-in outage view can persist failures it observes and send a recovery
summary when service returns. It cannot notify while the Jetson itself has no
power or network; true immediate offline alerts require an independently
powered monitor or UPS integration.

## Status

Working end-to-end on the Jetson Nano 2GB. Live video (WebRTC, ~200 ms LAN), detection events (SSD-MobileNet-v2 at FP16 with idle-gear thermal management), per-person face recognition (when `encodings.pkl` is present and dlib is unblocked), Web Push with VAPID, persisted detection config, and a Settings page surfacing per-component health (CPU/GPU temp, dropped frames, p95 inference latency, mediamtx-watchdog restart count, etc).

Privileged camera recovery and reboot commands are handed to the host-side worker instead of granting the FastAPI container host control.

## Security

The application uses cookie-based accounts and role checks for its protected API. Internal worker endpoints remain LAN-scoped, and an expiring share URL is an intentionally public bearer capability. Defenses include:

- 1 MB request-body cap (FastAPI middleware)
- `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: same-origin` on every response
- SPA path-traversal guard
- Pydantic `extra='forbid'` + length / range bounds on every accepted payload (event, push subscribe / unsubscribe, detection config). The worker heartbeat path is bounded by an explicit whitelist + per-field type coercion (numeric NaN/Inf rejection, string length caps, `face_recog_names` list-and-element bounds) — same defense, different mechanism because the body is optional and shape-tolerant.
- gzip middleware (≥1 KB responses) — browsers benefit, the worker's stdlib `urllib.request` does not send `Accept-Encoding` so the worker → server hot path stays uncompressed

Before exposing this beyond the LAN you still need:

- TLS (Caddy or Nginx in front of FastAPI + MediaMTX)
- Network isolation (a separate VLAN for IoT is wise)

Recommended remote-access path: install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on the Jetson and your phone. Free, encrypted, and the Jetson stays off the public internet.
